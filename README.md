# ReactU Episode #29

## Building a Memory Game

In today's example we will be building a memory game, where cards are displayed on the screen, face down, and as the user 'flips' them, two at a time, if there is a match, the cards stay face up. If not, they revert after a couple of seconds to face down and the game continues until the user gets all the matches.

### We will be using the following technologies and techniques to build our feature/app

- React (of course)
- Hooks
  - state
  - effects
- setTimeout
- CSS keyframes
